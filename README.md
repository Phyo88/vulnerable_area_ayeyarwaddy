# vulnerable_area_ayeyarwaddy

The maps depicting hard-to-reach areas and low-lying regions under 5 meters above sea level were generated using QGIS software. The objective of this project was to conduct an assessment of vulnerable areas within the Ayeyarwaddy region of Myanmar in the event of natural disasters such as Cyclone Nargis.
